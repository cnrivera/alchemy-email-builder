# Noel Rivera Email Builder Notes

## General thoughts on the assessment

I started the project by reading the Foundation for Emails documentation and setting up the project on my system. The documentation was straightforward enough, and the two additional videos I reviewed covered the basics of Inky tags and images in Foundation for Emails.

Following this, I blocked in the text and main images to match the Invision artboard. I then started focusing on individual items that needed to be addressed. First, the global width of the project and adjusting the image sizes to approximate the widths on the artboard.

Colors were sampled from the PSD files in Photoshop, and image sizes for the slices were viewed the same way. Image widths were applied inline, as my research suggested this was the most appropriate way to resize the images for email.

## What I learned

## Challenges

There was a problem with my npm start command that slowed me down at the beginning of the project. The command failed, which meant I was unable to open the server and view the email as it would appear when completed. While I could do a handful of things without npm to orient myself to Foundation for Emails, it ultimately had to be resolved before I could correctly render my work in the browser and complete the project. This required me to research several npm errors and to learn where to locate the npm modules folder in my project so I could delete it and reinstall npm. After updating my packages, deleting the folder, and reinstalling, I was able to run and view the project correctly.
