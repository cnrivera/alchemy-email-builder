# Noel Rivera Email Builder Notes

## General thoughts on the assessment

## What I learned

## Challenges

There was a problem with my npm start command that slowed me down at the beginning of the project. The command failed, which meant I was unable to open the server and view the email as it would appear when completed. While I could do a handful of things without npm to orient myself to Foundation for Emails, it ultimately had to be resolved before I could correctly render my work in the browser and complete the project. This required me to research several npm errors and to learn where to locate the npm modules folder in my project so I could delete it and reinstall npm. After updating my packages, deleting the folder, and reinstalling, I was able to run and view the project correctly.
